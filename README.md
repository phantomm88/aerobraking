# aerobraking
A repository for the calculation of aerobraking parameters aboard a probe for planetary entry.

aerobraking is a respository in progress. Although all the code currently avaiable is finished, more code is planned to be added that will be able to verify and validate aerobraking parameter calculations, as well as generalize the process to a wider array of planetary entry vehicles. The code is currently worked on being rewritten to transform the script-based programs into more object-oriented ones. In other words, using the available code will not involve creating objects or calling functions, but rather changing the parameters and data in the report.
